One of the features of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is the ability to customize the game's language and user interface (UI) according to the player's preference. This is done by using different files that contain the text and graphics for each language and UI element.

However, some players may encounter problems with the game's language and UI, such as missing text, incorrect fonts, or corrupted graphics. This can happen due to various reasons, such as installing unofficial patches, mods, or DLCs, changing the game's region settings, or deleting or modifying the FF files. To fix these issues, players may need to download and replace the original FF files for their desired language and UI.
